**NOTE 1: This is a personal project for self-education in Rust and not a robust implementation. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION OR FOR OTHER CRITICAL APPLICATIONS.**

**NOTE 2: MD5 is considered [cryptographically broken](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2022/11/30/serious-security-md5-considered-harmful-to-the-tune-of-600000/)**
